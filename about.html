            <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn more about us and what our purpose is! This website was built as a demo website for a class. The website was made to model a website that contains articles and videos where the content is surrounded around Wakeskating. Now I will take the time to explain my connection with wakeskating and why I have made a website surrounding the topic. The sport of wakeskating has made a huge impact in my life. I started riding around 3 years ago, and ever since I have had this love for the sport that keeps growing. The sport is farely new and started popping up around the 90's, with people cutting down wakeboards and applying a piece of griptape to the top of the wakeboard. Once adding the griptape the rider would wear skate shoes to ride the board. Now that you have a little knowledge about wakeskating let me tell you the purpose of this website. So a huge motivation behind wakeskating is spreading the sport around, because the sport is not well known and most riders want to present it to the world. This website has that motivation behind it, <b>THAT IS OUR PURPOSE!</b> We are here to spread the sport of wakeskating by making a website that is made just for wakeskating, because most watersports websites are based around wakeboarding magazines and have a sub section for wakeskating. Having wakeskate as a subsection on a wakeboarding magazine website limits the sport from growing, because most people going to these sites arent interested in wakeskating or dont know what it is and its not explained. Here is where wakeskating with begin to thrive!</p>
